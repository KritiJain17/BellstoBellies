Bells to Bellies as the name suggests is a way of mediating food between those who have plenty and those who have none. 
On entering our portal, the user visits the homepage. NGOs and hotels can register at our portal.
The hotels then select a date and time and approximate food that is expected to get wasted and it is listed on the page's main portal where the NGOs can select the time and date and the chosen hotel, and the hotel will dispatch the food to the allotted NGO.
We have created our project using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MySQL. We have started with 5 hotels as of now, but we have the vision of expanding PAN India and collaborating with more organizations.
We will also be installing food collection spots in the future and initiate schemes like Roti Bank soon. To keep the independency, we will be organizing some fundraising events like Cooking Competitions and bake sales. 
We hope you enjoy our site and help diminish the gap between the starving and the ones wasting!
